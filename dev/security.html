				<div class="alt-content-container security-question-container">
					<h2 class="h2 security-question">How do I know I can trust Mighty with my data?</h2>
					<p class="p-roboto">Mighty does three things to protect your data: your data lives on our secure servers that
						are audited by 3rd party security firms, it has tight control in terms of who can access it, access is
						heavily audited and logged, and your most sensitive data is also encrypted.<br><br>Mighty last ran a
						large-scale audit of its code and infrastructure in Feb, 2022 by a reputable security firm. We will
						regularly audit our infrastructure every year.</p>

				<div class="alt-content-container security-question-container">
					<h2 class="h2 security-question">Where is my data housed?</h2>
					<p class="p-roboto">Your data is stored on the virtual machine that you use in the cloud which is isolated
						from others. You have direct control over that information. Mighty does not store your data anywhere else.
						If you decide to leave the service, the data will be wiped and deleted.</p>

				<div class="alt-content-container security-question-container">
					<h2 class="h2 security-question">Who can access my data/browsing history?</h2>
					<p class="p-roboto">Your data will never be shared with another person or entity. There are strict policies
						internally about viewing someone’s browser history: it is prohibited. We use automated tools that access
						your instance in order to update your browser’s software to keep making Mighty better.</p>

				<div class="alt-content-container security-question-container">
					<h2 class="h2 security-question">How do I (or my company) verify that Mighty does not capture keystrokes?</h2>
					<p class="p-roboto">Mighty does not store keystrokes however we do capture keystrokes to send them from your
						local machine to your hosted machine in the cloud. Your keystrokes are encrypted over the wire when being
						sent.</p>

					<h2 class="h2 security-question">How do I have guarantees that Mighty isn’t going to do anything it shouldn’t?
					</h2>
					<p class="p-roboto">We believe that the people who use our service expect us to protect their information and
						their right to privacy as our top priority. We commit to keeping your browser history private, your logged
						in identity secure, and your information under your control. Let us be clear: your data will never be sold.
						We recognize that we earn our trust with you every day and that won’t be easy.</p>

					<h2 class="h2 security-question">Where is Mighty keeping all of the cookies? Are they on Mighty servers or my
						local device?</h2>
					<p class="p-roboto">Your cookies are stored on Mighty’s servers on a virtual machine that is isolated from
						other people’s machines and has tight control over who can access the machine directly. We access cookies
						stored on our servers so that your browser can be blazing fast versus incurring extra latency. We don't
						store those cookies anywhere else and you have complete control over which cookies are stored on your
						instance.</p>

				<div class="alt-content-container security-question-container">
					<h2 class="h2 security-question">How can I trust that Mighty will wipe my machine when I leave?</h2>
					<p class="p-roboto">We can send you an email receipt, if asked, to ensure you have our guarantee in writing
						that the action was taken. At Mighty, we view housing sensitive information from past users as risky and
						might make us more of a target. To minimize that risk, we prefer to not keep your data on the machine when
						you leave.</p>

					<h2 class="h2 security-question">How are you keeping my data separate from other users? Will “neighbors” on
						your system be able to observe what other browsers are doing/storing? How do you prevent those attacks?</h2>
					<p class="p-roboto">Mighty uses virtual machines which are widely accepted as secure for isolating
						environments. People will not be able to observe what other browsers are doing or are storing because of our
						controls around authentication, encryption, and other security measures<br><br>When your browser runs in the
						cloud, it keeps you safe every day if your local computer were to be compromised or stolen.</p>
